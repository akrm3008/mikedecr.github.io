      <description>With my dissertation research ramping up over the past few weeks, I found myself struck by how underdeveloped my workflow was for dealing with Bayesian model output. This is despite being an enthusiast of Bayesian methods and having used at least some Bayesian technology in my other research projects (see [1], [2]). I guess I happened to develop my initial Bayes chops on projects that didn’t hinge on “typical” regression-based research designs.</description>
