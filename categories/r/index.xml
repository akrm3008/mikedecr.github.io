      <description>Objective The goal of this lesson is to simulate some data manipulation for a research project. This requires…
 setting up the project on your computer Get data onto our computer (the ANES should already be downloaded!) Load the data into R Cleaning and modifying the data Doing some simple calculations using the data  Future lessons pick up where this one leaves off. We will be making graphics and doing statistical analysis.</description>

      <description>Objectives This document describes how to get started with R and understand its basics. We discuss installing R, running simple commands, and some elementary programming concepts such as indexing, logic, and functions. We close with some higher-level discussion about the differences between R and Stata.
Note: This lesson will be more “abstract” than other lessons in this series. This is because we exploring R’s general behavior rather than a concrete application of R workflow.</description>
