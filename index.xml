      <title>Packages &amp; Reproducibility: Install what you need, attach what you want</title>

      <description>(Note: An earlier version of this post referred to “loading” packages when I really meant “attaching.” Thanks to Thomas Leeper for the clarification.)
When we distribute R code (for publication/replication archives, on Github, through blog posts, etc), we like the code to run smoothly on someone else’s machine. Packages present a nominal problem because different users have different packages installed on their computer. Ideally the script we are distributing should install dependencies without the redundancy of re-installing packages that a user already has installed.</description>

      <description>Github This website is continuously undergoing revisions. For code currently that has no home on this page, feel free to dig through my Github repositories.
 Sublime Text User Settings Sublime Text is a powerful and customizable text editor that is great for social scientists. It has much of the extensibility as Vim and Emacs but with a friendlier interface. However, it does have text-based settings, which can be daunting for the uninitialized and a rabbit hole for the detail-obsessed.</description>

      <description>Schedule Read this before our final lecture, after the graphics lesson.
 How to follow along A script file walking through some of these commands is available here.
 Objectives In this lesson, we will introduce how to do statistical analysis using R. Topics that you should cover to prepare for the take-home exercise include…
 Means, confidence intervals, and simple significance tests Estimating regression models Generating model output Model diagnostics and fit statistics Post-estimation graphics (model predictions)  This page also contains some content on more advanced topics, but these won’t be necessary for the take-home exercise.</description>

      <description>Schedule: Read this before our second R lecture, after the data lesson.
 How to follow along A script file walking through some of these commands is available here.
 Objectives The goal of this lesson is to provide an introduction to graphics in R, by way of ggplot2 in particular. We will cover:
 The “grammar of graphics”—the “gg” in ggplot How ggplot2 works Common graphics in social science Customizing the appearance of ggplot graphic Saving graphics  Some notes to get us started:  This lesson makes liberal use of pipe chains, which bundle many operations together in one block of code.</description>

      <description>Schedule: Read this before our first R lecture.
 How to follow along A script file walking through some of these commands is available here.
 Objectives The goal of this lesson is to simulate some data manipulation for a research project. This requires…
 setting up the project on your computer Get data onto the computer (the ANES should already be downloaded!) Load the data into R Cleaning and modifying the data Doing some simple calculations  Future lessons pick up where this one leaves off, so you must complete this lesson!</description>

      <title>Getting Started with R</title>
      <link>https://mikedecr.github.io/811/811-basics/</link>

      <description>Schedule: Read this before our first R lecture.
 How to follow along Follow the instructions in this lesson in your own .R script.
 Objectives This document describes how to get started with R and understand its basics. We discuss installing R, running simple commands, and some elementary programming concepts such as indexing, logic, and functions. We close with some higher-level discussion about the differences between R and Stata.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the online lessons for PS 811: Introduction to Statistical Computing for Political Science. This series of blog posts contain instructional notes for using R for political science research.
This current post contains a few introductory remarks about R, how I intend to teach R, and the structure of our coming lessons.
Schedule: Read this before our first R lecture.
 A little about R R is not the only program out there for doing statistical programming, so let’s begin by talking about what makes it unique.</description>

      <description>I am a doctoral student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Madison. I study American politics and statistical methodology.
My research focuses on U.S. electoral politics, broadly construed (representation, voting, public opinion, and election administration) and Bayesian data analysis. My dissertation explores primary elections and the representation of local partisan preferences.
I am an affiliate of the Elections Research Center, where I also serve as the graduate student assistant.</description>

      <description>Dissertation Do Primaries Work? Nomination Politics and the Representation of Local Partisan Preferences. Partisan voters are historically unlikely to cast their votes for the opposing party, so the primary nomination process is perhaps more consequential than ever. Theoretical and empirical scholarship on candidate positioning argues that the primary process is the predominant reason for divergent candidate positions across parties. I argue that the core predictions from the prevailing theory of primaries lacks direct empirical support.</description>
