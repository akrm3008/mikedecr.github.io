# Sarah

- "advanced topics"
- things I plan to do already
  + pipes
  + dplyr
  + tidyverse
  + forcats
  + haven
  + readr
  + tidyr
  + stringr
- what is the tidy time series thing? hms?
- regex
  + just explain what it is. Not worth learning and not worth teaching right now
- text analysis: 
  + tm
  + tidytext
- time series stuff
  + lubridate
  + what other time series packages are out there
  + Stata is maybe better?
- R as front end
  + rcpp, sql, rpython (rselenium)
- learning new packages
- survey analysis
  + Sarah has a good story example!
  + Stata might be better
- Bayesian analysis: 
  + bugs, jags, stan
    * Jags probably easiest for custom models
      - learn JAGS from Gelman and Hill (who use BUGS but it's very similar)
      - Jackman Bayes textbook
    * Stan definitely the fastest but learn r-like (requires a C++ like file)
      - Gelman et al BDA
  + other packages for quick and dirty Bayes things
    * `brms`
    * `rethinking`
  + *decide how much you want to preach*


My advanced things:

- hierarchical models
  + figure out how badly you want this...
  + you like these but don't actually do them all that much
- function writing
- bayesian example
- apply and lapply
- nest and map
  + hierarchical: mrp?




# Introduction

- gelman quote about dumbest possible thing



# Nonstatistical approaches


## tabulating

## aggregating



# Univariate statistics


## means and CIs

## comparing CIs across groups

## simple means tests, chisq tests




# Regression

## lm

rescaling

## glm

Intuition of the GLM

- $E[Y] = g^{-1}(X\beta)$
- $Y = E[Y] + \epsilon$
- or $Y \sim \mathcal{D}(\theta)$


## lme4


## bayesian models



# Regression output


## regression tables

`xtable`, `stargazer`, `texreg`


## regression coef plots

don't use `coeftest`


`broom`,


## regression predictions

maybe avoid `effects`

use `sjplot`, `margins` for R


## marginal effects
