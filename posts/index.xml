      <description>Motivation for this post Over this summer, I have been organizing a reading group on causal inference for students in my department. As someone who sees data analysis problems primarily through Bayesian goggles, I have been doing extra work in my head to make sense of “Bayesian causal inference.” I’m hoping to write some articles about this for political scientists, but the dissertation (rightly) has more of my attention lately.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading about Bayesian causal inference for a paper I’m hoping to write, and this has led me to dig into the work by Gerber, Green, and Kaplan about the “Illusion of Learning from Observational Research.” In it, they put forth a model to describe how much you “update” your information about causal effects from experimental vs observational research.
The intuition of the model is to suppose that we want to learn about some causal effect \(M\).</description>

      <title>Great Hugo themes (that I did not pick)</title>
      <link>/2018/2018-09-23-hugo-themes/</link>

      <description>I just finished a major website overhaul. While it took only about one day of work, I’ve had my eyes open for a new theme for Hugo for a while.
I mean, a while. I would download a theme, give it a 15-minute test run offline, and decide that it wasn’t for me. I did that maybe a dozen times.1
But this is mainly my fault. I am a bad combination of picky and unskilled with websites and web design, which made me a fickle chooser throughout the process.</description>
