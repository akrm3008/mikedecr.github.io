## Intermediate Git: Branches, History, etc.

April 10, 2020

---

class: middle

.pull-left[
## Last Week

- Git basics

- Initializing, adding/staging, committing

- Local vs. remote repository

- Push to Github

]

--

.pull-right[

## This Week

- Review / Pushing to Github

- Datasets (Git LFS)

- Branches & Git "Flow"

- Time traveling in your Git history

]

---

# Review: so I have a new project

1. Create a directory ("folder") on your computer

1. Make it an **RStudio project**

1. Initialize the Git repository

1. Commit changes to source code

--

1. Review: create **remote repository** (on Github)

1. Connect to remote repo, push


---

# Setting up remote repository

.pull-left[

- On Github, **New Repository**

- In **Terminal** or **Git Bash**, navigate to project 

    - `cd path/to/project`
    - Other helpful commands:
        - type `pwd` to "print working directory"
        - `ls` to list folder contents
]

--

.pull-right[

- Paste commands from Github

    - `git remote add ...`
    - `git push ...`

- All future pushes will work **from Sourcetree**

# What to do about data?


---

# Can I commit data? (& other large files)

.pull-left[

Local repo (Git): no problem (in theory)

Remote repo (Github etc.): potential problem

- Rule of thumb: keep repo under 1 GB, no file more than 100MB
- If data are petite...no worries
- Learn more [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota) or [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/uploading-large-files-to-github-dbef518fa1a)

]

--

.pull-right[
What if my dataset is large?

- Use Git LFS ([download](https://git-lfs.github.com/))
- Or ignore data (`.gitignore`) & back it up somewhere else (Box/Dropbox, Amazon S3)


What if I already committed a big file?

- Can I undo? More later.
- Remove file from repo history ([tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history))

### Branches for new features / **merging** into `master` branch

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*RTgn1s0GY8r0rSPsAzf8NQ.png)

---



# Creating new branches

Is easy in Sourcetree. Click the "Branch" button.

Move between branches using `checkout`.

You can commit to a new branch as before, but changes only apply to that branch.

Why would I want to do this? Well...


---

## Git "Flow": branch-based project development

.left-code[

**Common in industry!** More [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [here](https://leanpub.com/git-flow/read)

- New features are developed on `feature` branches

- `feature` branches return to a `development` branch for reconciliation/testing

- `development` branch returns to `master` branch for "public release"
)

# Branchy things to remember: local changes

.pull-left[

I'm working on branch `A` and I want to move to (checkout) branch `B`.

- If I have committed my changes on `A`, this is seamless. 
- If I have uncommitted changes on `A`, I could lose them!

]

--

.pull-right[

What can I do about uncommitted local changes?

- I can `stash` changes on `A` (store changes without committing)
- Then `apply` stash on `B` (or anywhere else): apply changes to "working tree"
- `pop` stash will apply changes _and then delete the stash_ (riskier)

]


---

# Branchy things to remember: merge conflicts

.pull-left[
I want to merge branch `B` into `A`.

- If changes in `B` don't conflict with changes in `A`, this is seamless.

- If changes can't be reconciled: (spooky voice) _**merge conflict**_
]

--

.pull-right[

Resolving merge conflicts:

- Git alters your file to show you the conflicts

- The user (you) reconciles conflicts manually

- Scary at first but not so bad

]

## Branchy things to remember: merging vs. rebasing


.left-code[
- **Merging** incorporates feature branch changes with master branch. Feature branch stays intact.
- **Rebasing** pastes feature branch to the end of the master branch
- Merging often easier (but depends on circumstances). More [here](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/git-rebase-vs-merge-cc5199edd77c)

# Time Traveling in your Git History

---

# Trail of breadcrumbs

.pull-left[
Git leaves a trail of commits.

Commits can be on one branch, several branches, whatever.
]

--

.pull-right[

If I switch between branches, I change what I'm seeing in my files.

If I want to go "back in time," I would see what the project looked like at that time.
]

# Terminology: the HEAD

HEAD is you. Where are you right now?

The state of the project "as it appears in your files" depends on where the HEAD is "pointing"

If I change branches ("checkout a branch") the HEAD is pointing to the new branch. 

If I investigate a project as it existed in a previous commit, the HEAD is pointing to that previous commit.


---

# Checkout

Checkout moves the HEAD. (read more [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-checkout))

I switch branches by checking out a branch.

I can rewind to a previous commit by checking out a commit.

Checking out _does not change your history_. It only changes where you "are" / what you "see" in your files. 

However, you can lose uncommitted changes if you checkout a branch/commit without _stashing_.

## Two ways to undo commits: Reverting and Resetting

---


## Undoing by **Reverting**

- Creates a new commit that inverts a previous commit.

- Previous commit _remains in history_

![](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/git_undo_commit/undo_commits_images/03.svg)

.center[Reverting is a **forward-moving undo**]


---

.left-code[
## Undo by **Resetting**

- "Rewind" a repository, discard a commit entirely

- What happens to rewound changes? Depends...
    - `soft`: changes remain in files & are staged
    - `mixed`: changes remain in files, not staged
    - `hard`: changes are discarded from files

# Undo tips

When to do which ([link](https://dev.to/neshaz/when-to-use-git-reset-git-revert--git-checkout-18je)): 

- Usually safer to `revert` (doesn't throw anything away).
- Best not to `reset` if commits are already pushed to remote.

Link: [Undoing changes](https://gcapes.github.io/git-course/07-undoing/)

Link: [How to undo almost anything](https://github.blog/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/)

Link: [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/)

## Other terms

It's possible to "amend" a commit (e.g. a message, adding a file, etc.)

It's possible to "squash" multiple commits into one

Some of these tricks are possible _on the command line_ but not in Sourcetree (or other apps)


---

# Danger zone

What can you do to protect yourself before doing risky things with Git?

1. Create a **_local copy_** of your project to test out the maneuver

2. Push to remote **_before_** you start the maneuver. If local copy is ruined, `git clone` the remote so your local copy is your "most recent functioning version"

3. Nuclear option: delete the `.git` folder from your project entirely. Your files will be there, but the Git history will be GONE.


---

# Looking forward

Final project should be pushed to remote when it is done

- This only requires committing and pushing
- Fancy stuff (branches, reverting, resetting, etc.) NOT REQUIRED
