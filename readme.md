title: publishing directory for mikedecr.github.io
---



How it works:

- source directory `goa/` on local machine holds source files
- source changes are committed to remote `site-source` repository
- local site builds into local `mikedecr.github.io/` 
- local `mikedecr.github.io/` directory is committed and pushed to remote (this repo)
