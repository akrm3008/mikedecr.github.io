**[My research](/research/) focuses on electoral politics in the United States,** broadly construed. I study issues surrounding ideological representation, public opinion, vote choice and turnout, and election administration. My dissertation explores primary elections and the representation of local partisan preferences. 

**[My teaching experience](/teaching/) focuses on research methods, computing, and American elections.** The bulk of my teaching focuses on the mathematical, statistical, and software foundations for social science research. I teach these subjects for undergraduate and graduate students.

I am an affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu/), where I also serve as the graduate student assistant.
