# Agenda 

### 1. Bayesian statistics...WTF?

<!-- 

- Information vs. Belief
- What can we do?
    - Introduce extra-model information
    - regularization
    - stabilization

-->

### 2. Priors...WTF?

<!-- 
- types of priors
    - weak/diffuse priors
    - weakly informative priors
    - strongly informative priors
- how do we actually implement these priors
    - not for fixing confounding!
    - we don't usually do directional priors unless you're in an area of weak ID
    - Usually regularization and stabilization. Some prior that pulls me back to zero
- features of a probability distribution
    - concentration of probability
        - Normal: 68% of draws within 1 sd.
    - shape of the prior
 -->

### 3. Bayes in Action

???

- wrapping our head around what Bayesian statistics actually means

- Priors: the most difficult to swallow element of Bayes, so we can talk about how to think about that

- What it looks like to think through a problem as a Bayesian

You get the whole distribution

- A Bayesian model has the mathematical machinery to define the entire posterior distribution
- Sometimes the solutions are very complicated, and it doesn't make sense to just compute the posterior distribution analytically
- To get around that, we usually "estimate" a model by generating samples of the posterior distribution, and then manipulating those samples
- The algorithms that generate those samples are called "Markov chain Monte Carlo" algorithms, which you might have seen before. They are basically just algorithms that explore and figure out how to sample a complex distribution

Simple regression, answers are similar

Frequentist inference:

- statistics are estimates of parameters
- uncertainty from repeated sampling

.pull-right[

Bayesian inference: 

- All of the above, _plus a prior_
- Priors are "subjective beliefs"
- Priors are "penalties" on new data
- "Penalized maximum likelihood"

]


???

Why don't I like this?

- makes Bayes look kind of absurd
- if priors are nothing more than extra fixtures, I should just get rid of them.
- If priors are subjective, then the whole exercise seems like it's misguided. 
- There may be other ways to penalize that are more principled than consulting my beliefs, for instance doing some kind of MSE-optimal penalization that I'm tuning by cross-validating a model or something, which is more like machine learning

A Bayesian model is a joint model for **all parts of the system**
\begin{align}
  p(y, \theta) \equiv p(y \cap \theta) \equiv p(y \mid \theta)p(\theta)

Run the model **forward** (generate $y$):
\begin{align}
  \theta \longrightarrow p(y, \theta) \longrightarrow p(y \mid \theta)
\end{align}

Run the model **backward** (update $\theta$):
\begin{align}
  y \longrightarrow p(y, \theta) \longrightarrow p(\theta \mid y)
\end{align}

Joint model:

- nothing different about data and parameters
- Only one is observed
- the moment we have missing data, we're suddenly in exactly the same world

The model is a description of the types of process that generate variables

- functional, distributional relationships between variables
- The joint model contains _more than_

Posterior is the payoff

Precision wt: means that the prior has consequences for what our conclusions are

- Prior isn't beliefs, so posterior isn't beliefs. We shouldn't trust the posterior too much as "the truth" or as an "automatic inference engine." It's a construct of the model. It only makes sense in the world of the model. The posterior fails to account for any way that the model isn't "good enough" for the real world.

## Bayes for Practical Research

class: middle

.pull-left[

## Benefits

- Conceptual basis for uncertainty

- Confidence interval vs. Bayesian interval

- Actually **easier to explain** to decision-makers

- In the real world: getting the answer right

]

--

.pull-right[

## Drawbacks

- Slower to build models

- Slower to fit models (Markov chain Monte Carlo)

- Doesn't fix other big problems (likelihood specification, confounding, data accuracy)

- In academia? People hate you

## Things we did not talk about

.pull-left[

- Which prior "families" [make sense](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations)? (conjugacy, entropy, Jeffreys, etc)

- "Default" priors ([Normal? T?](https://twitter.com/avehtari/status/1218896617346162688))
