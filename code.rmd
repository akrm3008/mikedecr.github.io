## Templates for $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ and R Markdown

Document styles with a personal touch, [available on Github](https://github.com/mikedecr/document-templates). Beware for Minion/Myriad font packages that may not be set up for $\mathrm{pdf\LaTeX}$ (or use $\mathrm{Xe\LaTeX}$).

Currently, the only template available is the [$\mathrm{pdf\LaTeX}$ article](https://github.com/mikedecr/document-templates/blob/master/tex/pdflatex/article/pdflatex-article.pdf).



## Workshop materials

My materials for [$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$](https://github.com/mikedecr/latex-workshop-2018) and [math camp](https://github.com/mikedecr/math-camp-2018) workshops are all open source and online.



## Sublime Text User Settings

The [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) editor is a great mix of [extensibility](https://packagecontrol.io/) and usability for social science, but its [text-based settings](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/customization/settings.html) can be daunting for the uninitialized and a rabbit hole for the detail-obsessed.

My settings can be viewed and pilfered at will from [Github](https://github.com/mikedecr/sublime-user-settings). Highlights include:

- Keybindings (primarily for R and $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$) and associated macro files.
- Code snippets for various languages---mainly R and $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$, but some for Stan, Stata, HTML, and Markdown.
- Modified `solarized` color schemes, available in light, dark, and lastly "gray," which is a weird hybrid of a few color schemes.



## Github

This website is continuously undergoing revisions, and some useful code may have no home on this page. Feel free to dig around in my [Github repositories](https://github.com/mikedecr).
