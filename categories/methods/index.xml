      <description>Background A few days ago, Andrew Heiss was looking for a way to visualize multiple regression with an emphasis on one predictor, without 3(+)-dimensional plots. He works through a method and posts this cool animation, which shows the changing relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) when adding controls, superimposed over the scatterplot of the raw data. (He credits Pete Mohanty with the shifting abline idea.)

      <title>Packages &amp; Reproducibility: Install what you need, attach what you want</title>

      <description>(Note: An earlier version of this post referred to “loading” packages when I really meant “attaching.” Thanks to Thomas Leeper for the clarification.)
When we distribute R code (for publication/replication archives, on Github, through blog posts, etc), we like the code to run smoothly on someone else’s machine. Packages present a nominal problem because different users have different packages installed on their computer. Ideally the script we are distributing should install dependencies without the redundancy of re-installing packages that a user already has installed.</description>
