- How much is politics a part of your life
  + part of how you understand and interpret the world
  + for some people, it's like particles that don't interact
- It's social
  + positive: 
    * getting the marginally engaged into politics together
    * modeling behavior
    * having someone to talk to about things
    * highly informed have a community element to their engagement with politics
  + negative
    * social pressure
- Information matters
  + knowing how to make sense of issues
    * which side stands for what
    * being able to connect issues to candidates and parties, understanding what the parties stand for, knowing which issues connect to other issues
  + knowing when elections are
  + having the experience of voting
  + details of the process
    * this is also where our work comes in
  + I've spoken with a lot of people who are right on the edge of participating, but they don't quite know how to focus their feelings into a decision about whom to support or a framework for thinking about politics
