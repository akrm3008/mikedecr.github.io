      <description>Charles Stewart tweeted some figures on the estimated average wait time to vote in 2018 (compared to 2014 and 2016). These data come from the CCES and the SPAE. Interestingly, neither of these surveys are able to get a direct measure of wait time. This makes sense; a voter will not remember if they were in line for 6 minutes versus 7. Instead, the surveys ask for a binned response.</description>
