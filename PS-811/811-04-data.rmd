# Sarah

- data management
  + loading datasets
    * *foreign vs haven, base vs. readr, readxl (is that right?)*
- Creating new variables
- dropping and keeping variables
- missing data
- merging and combining
  + appending
  + merging
- reshaping
  + long and wide
- aggregating/collapsing
- saving transformed data
  + *for later use! eg if you want to do a state analysis from lower data*
- intermediate logical functions
  + vector `ifelse()` and atomic `if (condition && condition) {this} else {that}`
  + `case_when()` for when you have lots of things you want to check, and the `ifelse()` idea gets too bloaty
  + looping
    * *You can*
    * *You shouldn't*
  + apply functions
    * here's a list of elements
    * perform function on every element individually


- what sarah does not have
  + tidy data
    * https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10
  + tidyverse
    * make untidy data tidy with `tidyr` (hadley): https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/
    * manipulate tidy data with `dplyr`
    * why dplyr: https://rpubs.com/justmarkham/dplyr-tutorial
    * how i learned: https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/data_wrangling
  + manipulating strings and factors
- Tidy
  + now when I see base code, I see a wall of gibberish
  + it's a *wall* because there is so much
  + it's gibberish because it isn't fucking readable
    * nested
    * the syntax itself requires translation.
    * tidy verbs mean what they say
- what I should change
  + directory management




# Intro

- should already download the ANES cumulative data file

data lesson!


# Data frames



## Multiple data frames

## Creating data



# The tidyverse

## Packages

## Piping





# Reading external data




# Modifying existing data

Principles?

- identifiers in variables 
  + (no named vectors)
  + this is why I've stopped using `table()` or `tapply()` except for checking



## Handy tools for different data types

`stringr`, `forcats`, `case_when`, `ifelse()`, `seq()`

time series (lag, lead)

- Time series is just hard and you're going to spend a lot of time beating your head against a wall. There is nothing I can do to fix this. But here are some tools that you should check out to help you.
- Fixing data: 
  + stata has `tsset` and you feed it a date, maybe a group
  + dplyr: `group_by(whatever)`, `arrange(date)`
  + lags and leads just work on rows, so it won't *know* to grab the previous date
- `zoo`? Creates an index variable
- `xts` requires the index to be a date
- lubridate for date/time modification
- RcppRoll for rolling averages
- tidyquant has period-level apply functions (apply something weekly, for example)






# Shaping data




# Analysis routines

## Summarizing

## Tabulating

## Aggregating
