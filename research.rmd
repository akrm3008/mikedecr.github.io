## Do Primaries Work? Nomination Politics and the Representation of Local Partisan Preferences.

For decades, primary elections have been widely believed to polarize candidates for office away from median-converging policy platforms. The fear of primary challenges may bolster the ideological consistency of incumbent officeholders, but does this function of primaries improve the representation of local constituencies? Do candidates take polarized positions because that is what their nominating constituencies prefer? Or is it simply the case that safe majorities in the general election allow candidates to take polarized positions.

```

I argue that key predictions from the prevailing theory of primaries lack direct empirical support. Are primary candidate positions meaningfully related to the preferences of district co-partisans? Are polarized primary constituencies more likely to nominate polarized primary candidates? I develop Bayesian measurement methods for estimating local partisan preferences, allowing us to assess these claims more directly than ever before. I explore whether the dominant theory about primaries---and it turn, about the nature of divergent candidate positioning in the U.S.---is empirically supported.

## The Unexceptional Gender Gap of 2016 (with Barry C. Burden and Evan Crawford). *The Forum* 14(4):425--432 (2016).

The 2016 presidential campaign was defined by gender to a remarkable degree, which led many observers to expect a historically large gender gap in voting. In reality, the difference between men and women's votes in 2016 was only slightly larger than in other recent elections. We argue that an immense gender divide did not emerge because it was constrained by high levels of partisanship in the electorate, especially "negative partisanship" toward the opposing party that leaves little room for gender to make a difference on the margins. In addition, we challenge two common assumptions: that the gender gap helps Democratic candidates and that women were more persuadable than men over the course of the campaign. Both men and women vacillated in their views of Clinton's honesty during the campaign, with men shifting away from her and toward Trump just before election day.

## Mobilization, Persuasion, and the Partisan Fallout of the Gender Gap in U.S. Voting (with Barry C. Burden) 

[View [PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0poj17dqqkda3jv/gender-gap-apw-2018.pdf?dl=0) and [appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lnmgj5i0f3vaodx/gap-appendix-apw-2018.pdf?dl=0)]

Does the gender gap help the Democrats? Do Republicans win more votes when the gender gap is smaller? To answer this question, we develop a generalizable theoretical framework to understand the link between group differences in voting and party vote shares, with an application to the gender gap. 

Theoretically, our approach views both the gender gap and partisan election outcomes as underlying partisan predispositions in the electorate that are transformed through partisan mobilization, partisan defection, and the choices of unaffiliated voters. We argue that the size of the gender gap has no *necessary* bearing on the partisan vote outcome. Rather, the relationship is contingent on the changing numerical impact of partisanship, mobilization, and persuasion over time.  

Empirically, both the gender gap and the Democratic vote in presidential elections have increased over time, but this relationship is almost entirely spurious. The primary cause of the gender gap (partisan change among men) was harmful to the Democrats. Meanwhile, the forces that increased the Democratic vote (greater mobilization and less defection among Democratic partisans) were relatively gender neutral.

Our framework can be extended to understand how other group cleavages such as race, formal education, and urban/rural divides affect election outcomes.



## Voter Identification and Nonvoting in Wisconsin---Evidence from the 2016 Election (with Kenneth R. Mayer) 

[View [PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f3jcbu2zneq5oik/nonvoters-rnr.pdf?dl=0),
[appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lnmgj5i0f3vaodx/nonvoters-appendix.pdf?dl=0), 
and [questionnaire](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6hldn82w7ccfrlw/p1208-nonvoters-questionnaire.pdf?dl=0)]

How much did Wisconsin's voter identification requirement matter in 2016? Who is affected by voter ID requirements? 

We conducted a survey of registered Wisconsin nonvoters in the counties surrounding Milwaukee and Madison to estimate the number of registered voters who were affected by the voter ID requirement in 2016. Using a conservative Bayesian estimate, we find that roughly 10 percent of nonvoters in these counties lacked a qualifying voter ID or reported that voter ID was at least a *partial* reason why they did not vote in 2016, and 6 percent of nonvoters lacked a voter ID or cited voter ID as their *primary* reason for not voting. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/research/nonvoters-teaser.png")
```

We argue that voter ID requirements affect a larger share of the public than those who lack a qualifying ID. Voter ID requirements contain technical details surrounding outdated addresses, expiration dates, and name changes that are likely to confuse and deter citizens who possess qualifying forms of ID as well. We find evidence of this confusion effect: many respondents mistakenly believe that they did not have the necessary ID to vote when they actually did, and individuals who were less knowledgeable about qualifying forms of ID were more likely to report being affected by the law. These "indirect effects" of voter ID reveal that record-linkage approaches to studying ID possession may underestimate the population affected by voter ID laws.

While we do not estimate the causal effect of voter ID on turnout, we do perform a simulation to demonstrate a range of plausible turnout effects under various assumptions.

## Bayesian Causal Inference in Political Science

[View [draft](https://github.com/mikedecr/causal-bayes/blob/master/writing/causal-bayes-paper.pdf)]

Causal inference and Bayesian analysis are two powerful and attractive methodological approaches for conducting empirical research, but rarely in political science does a single study employ both approaches. This stands in contrast to other fields---such as psychology, epidemiology, and biostatistics---where Bayesian and causal methods are more commonly applied together. In this paper I argue that the partition between these methodological schools in political science has no inherent basis in their fundamental goals, which are actually quite compatible: generating the best parameter estimates. In fact, Bayesian analysis provides a number of distinct benefits for estimating statistical models for causal inference. The methodological partition instead owes itself to informal norms surrounding each school in empirical political science. I discuss these sources of normative tension, describe go-to practices doing Bayesian inference for a skeptical audience, and demonstrate these practices using real examples from recent political science publications. The purpose of the paper is *not* to convince all causal inference practitioners to adopt Bayesian estimation. The purpose is to show that Bayesian methods deserve space in the study of causal effects because they improve causal estimates and provide an appealing framework for evaluating causal evidence.
