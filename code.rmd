This website is continuously undergoing revisions. For code currently that has no home on this page, feel free to dig through my [Github repositories](https://github.com/mikedecr).



# Sublime Text User Settings

Available on [Github](https://github.com/mikedecr/sublime-user-folder/blob/master/Default%20(OSX).sublime-keymap). Highlights include:

- Keybindings for R and $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ (primarily) and associated macro files.
- Code snippets for R and $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$, plus some for Stan, Stata, HTML, and Markdown.
- A modified Solarized color scheme based on the guts of the [Cobalt2](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2) scheme for Sublime, [light](https://github.com/mikedecr/sublime-user-folder/blob/master/solarized-smart-light.tmTheme) and [dark](https://github.com/mikedecr/sublime-user-folder/blob/master/solarized-smart-dark.tmTheme) versions.



# $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ files

Coming soon: preambles for `article` and `memoir` classes
