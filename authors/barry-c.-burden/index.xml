      <title>Partisanship, Mobilization, and Persuasion in Group Voting: A Study of the Gender Gap

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Groups in the electorate vote differently from one another.
Racial minorities and young voters prefer Democratic candidates on average, while evangelicals and rural voters prefer Republican candidates.
How do these group differences affect party vote shares, given that the underlying groups are differently sized?
Most research characterizes voting preferences by conditioning vote choices on group membership, which obscures the numerical impact of group dynamics in voting across time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lay out a theoretical framework and a generative modeling approach to understand how group differences in voting evolve over time and aggregate into election outcomes.
The approach decomposes group shares into useful theoretical components for understanding how groups affect elections and in what way: partisan predispositions, partisan mobilization, swing voting, and the choices of party-unaffiliated voters.
The method traces how these theoretical mechanisms change over time, and it can be extended for multichotomous groups and more complex hierarchical modeling approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We apply this new method to the gender gap in U.S. presidential voting.
Many observers speculate that a larger gender gap in voting—larger Democratic vote shares among women than among men—numerically benefits the Democratic Party.
We show, by contrast, that the size of the gender gap has no necessary bearing on the partisan vote outcome.
Rather, the relationship is contingent on the changing numerical impact of partisanship, partisan mobilization, and persuasion over time.
Although the gender gap and the Democratic vote in presidential elections have both increased over the years, this relationship is spurious.
The primary cause of the gender gap (partisan change) was actually harmful to the Democrats.
Meanwhile, forces that increased the Democratic vote (mobilization and persuasion) were minor influences on the gender gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights enabled by this approach can be extended to other salient groups in the electorate including race, urban/rural divisions, socioeconomic groups, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
